# xlNode_java

This is a Java implementation of the
[XLattice](https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice)
[node](https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/node).
XLattice is a secure
[peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)
communications infrastructure.

## Projecst Status

This is the 2006
[Sourceforge](http://xlattice.sourceforge.net)
implementation adapted to make its unit tests succeed under Java 8.
The code is stable and all unit tests pass.

While the Java code is stable in its current form, it is not
interoperable with the
[Go](https://jddixon.github.io/xlNode_go)
and
[Python3](https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice)
implementations of the code.
